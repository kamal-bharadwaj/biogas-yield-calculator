# Biogas Yield Calculator ♻️🔥

A web-based **Biogas Yield Calculator** that helps estimate biogas and biomethane production from different feedstocks.  
This tool is designed for researchers, engineers, and students working on renewable energy and sustainable waste management.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Calculate **biogas yield** from various feedstocks.  
- Estimate **methane content** and **energy potential**.  
- Lightweight and easy-to-use web interface.  
- Supports user-defined inputs and preset values.  
- Can be extended for scientific or educational use.

## 📦 Requirements
This project is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no external dependencies required.  
It runs directly in any modern web browser.  

---

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamal-bharadwaj/biogas-yield-calculator.git
   cd biogas-yield-calculator


That’s it! No installation required. ✅

▶️ Usage

Enter the feedstock details (e.g., quantity, type, volatile solids).

Choose from presets if available.

Click Calculate to see estimated biogas yield and methane potential.

Results will display in real time with clear values.
